//! Stdout trust classification for tool output.
//!
//! The orchestrator runs a regex safety net over raw tool stdout
//! (`ares-cli`'s `output_extraction`) to catch credentials, hashes, hosts,
//! users, and shares the per-tool parsers missed. Not every tool's stdout is
//! equally trustworthy: some tools echo whatever command the LLM chose, and
//! some echo AD attribute or file content an attacker can plant. This module is
//! the single source of truth for that classification.
//!
//! It lives beside the tool definitions on purpose. The classification keys on
//! the *registered* tool name (the same string that lands in
//! `ToolOutput::name`), so it can never silently drift from the registry — the
//! `every_classified_tool_is_registered` test fails the build if a name here
//! stops matching a real tool. That guard exists because the previous
//! hand-maintained blocklist in the extraction module keyed on plausible-
//! sounding binary names (`mssqlclient`, `evil-winrm`, `rpcclient`) that never
//! matched the actual tool names (`mssql_command`, `evil_winrm`,
//! `rpcclient_command`), so the gate was a no-op for most of the surface it
//! claimed to cover.
