/// key off a variant instead of substring-matching an error string across
/// three crates. Absent (`None`) means either the tool succeeded, or the
/// producing worker predates this field — string-fallback still applies
/// in the runner for backward compatibility with an in-flight rollout.
///
/// The two spawn-time kinds are the load-bearing distinction:
///
/// - [`BinaryNotFound`] (ENOENT from `Command::spawn`) — the binary is
///   genuinely absent from the worker's PATH. Safe to cache and prune;
///   won't self-heal until the operator installs the tool or the cache
///   backoff expires.
/// - [`TransientSpawn`] (EAGAIN/ENOMEM/EMFILE/EACCES/other `io::ErrorKind`s
///   at spawn time) — the OS refused *this* spawn attempt for reasons
///   that will very likely clear on the next tick. MUST NOT cache or
///   prune; one bad spawn used to nuke recon primitives for the rest of
///   the op.
///
/// [`ToolError`] is the catch-all for non-spawn failures (tool ran to
/// completion but exited non-zero, wrapper-level arg validation, timeout,
/// KDC error, etc.). Not currently used by the classifier — kept as an
/// explicit "not a spawn failure" signal so future callers don't have to
/// guess.
